🧠 What if your notebook worked like your brain?

It's been a while since I started developing this idea—a notebook where all notes stay connected, with a visual presentation that resembles how our minds actually work.

I read about Knowledge Graphs, JSON, and D3.js, and I started building NodeBook: a multi-purpose web app that I use as both a notebook and a process/workflow application.

The goal? One notebook that has it all.

✨ What it does:

- Interactive, force-directed graph visualization

- Map relationships between ideas, concepts, and processes

- Find the paths between nodes

- Import/export with tables for bulk data

- Combine/Explode JSONs

- Full undo/redo history (50 levels)

- Export to JSON, PNG, SVG

🔒 Privacy by design: This app collects nothing. No servers. No accounts. No tracking. It runs entirely in your browser—your data never leaves your device. (Just remember to save your files!)

I'm inviting you to test it and help me develop it further with your feedback. What features would you want? What's confusing? What's broken? I want to hear it all.

Thanks for being part of this journey. 🙏
