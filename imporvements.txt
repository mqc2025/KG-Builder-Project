I need these improvements, let's plan for them: The option to import and combine with the current graph with Import button.

1. For the path finder, can I have the start and end nodes as a dropdown boxes with type search (to eventuallly select form the dowpdown)?
2. can I have a hover effect that when hovering a node or an edge, thier the description, prioroty, deadline and custom properties be listed (the description and custom properties for an edge)?
3. add another JSON file to combine with the current graph with Import button.
4. Size of a node to be related to the number of edges it has.
5. Physics force intensity setting during visualization.
6.1 Properties panel for edges; the type is not what I like. I like it to be a dropdown boxes with type search (to eventuallly select form the dowpdown)
6.2. reverse direction option.
7.1 Right-click "Delete Edge" is not working
7.2 Right-click "Reverse direction" is not working
7.3 Remove the Break at Source and Break at Target.
8. Right-click on node "Change Color" and "Delete Node " are not working. remove duplicates and merge with. 
9. Connect to Node with a searchable dropdown
10. Search improvement with visual clues and the node being selected.
11. remove Cluster and Merge off of left panel.
