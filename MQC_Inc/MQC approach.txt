Here's a strategic roadmap to attract clients for your quality engineering and management services:
1. Define Your Service Portfolio
Core Services to Highlight:
*	ISO 9001/AS9100 implementation and certification consulting
*	Quality management system development and optimization
*	Manufacturing process improvement and defect reduction
*	Supplier qualification and audit services
*	Non-conformance management (NCR/CAR) systems
*	First Article Inspection (FAI) and validation services
*	Materials testing and characterization consulting
*	Root cause analysis and failure investigation
2. Target Market Identification
Primary Sectors:
*	Aerospace manufacturers (your strongest background)
*	Defense contractors requiring AS9100 compliance
*	Automotive suppliers needing quality systems
*	Medical device manufacturers (similar quality requirements)
*	Manufacturing companies preparing for ISO certification
Client Types:
*	Small-to-medium manufacturers lacking internal quality expertise
*	Companies facing audit failures or customer complaints
*	Organizations expanding into aerospace/defense markets
*	Startups needing quality systems from the ground up
3. Leverage Your Network
Immediate Actions:
*	Contact your references (Vincent Pillai at LISI, J-F Giraud at Bombardier) for referrals
*	Reach out to former colleagues at Stelia, P&W, Bombardier, and ÉTS
*	Connect with suppliers and vendors you worked with previously
*	Join professional associations (ASQ, SAE, AIAA local chapters)
4. Build Credibility and Visibility
Professional Development:
*	Complete your ASQ CQE certification if not already done
*	Consider AS9100 Lead Auditor certification
*	Obtain ISO 14001 or IATF 16949 certifications to expand market reach
*	Join speaking circuits at manufacturing and quality conferences
Content Marketing:
*	Write articles about quality challenges in aerospace manufacturing
*	Share case studies (anonymized) of your process improvements
*	Create LinkedIn content about quality best practices
*	Develop white papers on topics like "Implementing AS9100 in Small Manufacturers"
5. Pricing and Service Structure Recommended Approach:
*	Hourly consulting: $75-125/hour (based on Canadian market)
*	Project-based: Fixed fees for specific deliverables (ISO implementation, audit prep)
*	Retainer model: Monthly fee for ongoing quality support
*	Training services: Group rates for quality system training
Service Packages:
*	"Quality Readiness Assessment" (entry-level diagnostic)
*	"ISO 9001 Implementation Package" (3-6 month program)
*	"AS9100 Upgrade Program" (for companies with existing ISO 9001)
*	"Supplier Quality Management Setup"
6. Overcome Common Limitations
Budget Constraints:
*	Offer phased implementation approaches
*	Provide ROI calculations showing cost savings from defect reduction
*	Consider performance-based pricing tied to measurable improvements
Trust Building:
*	Offer free initial consultations or quality assessments
*	Provide references from your extensive background
*	Start with smaller pilot projects to prove value
Geographic Limitations:
*	Focus initially on Quebec/Ontario aerospace corridor
*	Offer remote consulting for documentation and system design
*	Partner with local consultants in other regions
7. Marketing Channels
Direct Outreach:
*	LinkedIn prospecting to quality managers and plant managers
*	Cold email campaigns to manufacturers in target industries
*	Attendance at trade shows (AIAC, FARNBOROUGH, local manufacturing events)
Referral Programs:
*	Offer finder's fees to former colleagues for referrals
*	Build relationships with complementary consultants (lean manufacturing, ERP implementation)
*	Partner with certification bodies and training organizations
Digital Presence:
*	Professional website highlighting your aerospace experience
*	Google Ads targeting "ISO 9001 consultant" and "AS9100 certification"
*	Industry-specific online directories
8. Implementation Timeline
Month 1-2: Set up business structure, complete certifications, build marketing materials Month 3-4: Launch networking campaign, complete website, begin content marketing Month 5-6: 
Focus on direct outreach and first client acquisition Month 7-12: Scale based on initial client feedback and referrals
9. Key Success Factors
*	Leverage your aerospace credibility - this is your strongest differentiator
*	Focus on measurable results - emphasize your track record of defect reduction
*	Build long-term relationships - quality consulting often leads to ongoing support needs
*	Stay current - aerospace standards evolve, maintain your technical edge
Your combination of hands-on manufacturing experience, quality system expertise, and aerospace industry knowledge positions you very well in this market. The key is translating that technical credibility into business relationships and demonstrating clear value to potential clients.
